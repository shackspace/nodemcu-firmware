The [issues list on GitHub](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/issues) is **not** the right place to ask for help. Use it to report bugs and to place feature requests. Questions like "how do I ..." or "I can't get this to work ..." should be directed to StackOverflow or esp8266.com.

## StackOverflow
StackOverflow is the perfect place to ask coding questions. Use one or several of the following tags: [esp8266](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/esp8266), [nodemcu](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/nodemcu) or [Lua](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/lua).

## esp8266.com Forums
esp8266.com has a few [NodeMCU specific forums](http://www.esp8266.com/viewforum.php?f=17) where a number of our active community members tend to hang out.
